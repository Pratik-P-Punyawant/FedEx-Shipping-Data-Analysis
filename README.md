# FedEx-Shipping-Data-Analysis

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of FedEx shipping data using Python. The goal is to uncover key insights related to shipment trends, delivery performance, cost distribution, and operational efficiency.

The analysis includes:

* Cleaning and preprocessing shipping records

* Analyzing shipping costs, delivery timelines, and service types

* Identifying peak shipping times and high-cost routes

* Visualizing performance metrics using Matplotlib and Seaborn

* Deriving insights to help improve logistics planning and cost control

The notebook serves as a case study in supply chain analytics and can support decision-making in logistics, cost optimization, and customer service strategy.
